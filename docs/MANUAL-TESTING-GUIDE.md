**Bug #12 (LOW)** - Marketplace Cache Not Auto-Refreshing After Purchase

- Status: ✅ FIXED (Oct 16, 2025)
- Location: `/marketplace` page after NFT purchase
- Impact: Marketplace still shows sold NFT until hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Root Cause: React Query cache not invalidating after `buyNFT` transaction success
- Fix Applied: Added `useQueryClient` and cache invalidation in NFT detail page (~20 lines)
  - Invalidates: `marketplaceListings`, `nftDetail`, `userNFTs`, `userListings`
  - Triggers automatic refetch of all affected queries
  - Now marketplace, dashboard, and NFT detail pages update automatically after purchase
- Testing: Requires new purchase transaction to verify auto-refresh works

**Bug #13 (HIGH)** - Dashboard Horizontal Scroll on Mobile (iPhone SE)

- Status: 🔴 NOT FIXED (Oct 16, 2025)
- Location: `/dashboard` page
- Impact: Significant horizontal overflow on iPhone SE (652px width vs 375px viewport = 277px overflow)
- Root Cause: Dashboard components not properly responsive on small mobile screens
- Priority: HIGH - Poor mobile UX, users must scroll horizontally
- Testing: Detected via Playwright automated testing on 375px viewport
- Recommendation: Investigate dashboard layout CSS, likely needs mobile-specific grid adjustments

**Bug #14 (MEDIUM)** - Landing Page Minor Horizontal Scroll on Mobile

- Status: 🔴 NOT FIXED (Oct 16, 2025)
- Location: `/` landing page
- Impact: Minor horizontal overflow on iPhone SE (417px width vs 375px viewport = 42px overflow)
- Root Cause: Some element(s) exceeding viewport width on mobile
- Priority: MEDIUM - Slight scroll, less critical than dashboard
- Testing: Detected via Playwright automated testing on 375px viewport
- Note: Marketplace and Register pages work perfectly (no overflow)

**Bug #15 (LOW)** - Button Tap Targets Below 44px Minimum

- Status: 🔴 NOT FIXED (Oct 16, 2025)
- Location: Top navbar buttons
- Impact: Language toggle (103x38, 6px short) and Connect Wallet (93x40, 4px short) buttons below Apple's 44x44 minimum
- Priority: LOW - Minor accessibility issue, buttons still tappable
- Testing: Detected via Playwright automated testing on 375px viewport
- Recommendation: Increase button padding to meet 44px minimum height
