# Frontend Design 2 - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project**: KaryaChain - Alternative Frontend Design
**Version**: 1.0
**Target Network**: Sepolia Testnet
**Timeline**: October 14-22, 2025 (8 days)
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines requirements for **KaryaChain Frontend Design 2** - a complete redesign of the copyright protection platform with:
- **Glassmorphism UI** with rich, professional animations
- **Alternative navigation structure** for improved UX discovery
- **Same technical stack** (Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, wagmi v2, RainbowKit)
- **All pages rebuilt from scratch** with fresh information architecture

**Goal**: Provide RECTOR with two production-ready frontend options to choose from before hackathon submission (Oct 22, 2025).

---

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Identity
- **Glassmorphism Core**: Frosted glass effects, backdrop blur, translucent cards
- **Rich Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions, micro-interactions, scroll-triggered animations
- **Professional Polish**: Subtle gradients, smooth transitions, premium feel
- **Indonesian Cultural Elements**: Batik patterns as subtle backgrounds, traditional color palette

### Color Palette
```css
/* Primary Colors */
--glass-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)
--glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)
--backdrop-blur: 20px

/* Indonesian-Inspired Gradients */
--gradient-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)
--gradient-secondary: linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%)
--gradient-accent: linear-gradient(135deg, #4facfe 0%, #00f2fe 100%)

/* Glass Overlays */
--glass-dark: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)
--glass-light: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)
```

### Animation Principles
- **Entrance Animations**: Fade in + slide up (stagger for lists)
- **Hover States**: Scale, glow, backdrop brightness increase
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth fade + slide between routes
- **Loading States**: Skeleton shimmer + pulse effects
- **Success States**: Confetti, scale bounce, gradient shift

## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration**: 8 days (October 14-22, 2025)

| Epic | Duration | Completion Target |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Epic 1: Design System & Foundation | 2 days | Oct 15 |
| Epic 2: Core User Flows | 4 days | Oct 19 |
| Epic 3: Advanced Features & Polish | 2 days | Oct 21 |
| **Buffer & Final Testing** | 1 day | Oct 22 |

**Critical Path**: Epic 1 â†’ Epic 2 (Stories 2.1-2.4) â†’ Epic 3 (Story 3.3)

---

## Risk Management

### High Risk
- **Timeline Pressure**: 8 days for complete rebuild
  - Mitigation: Focus on MVP features, defer non-critical animations

- **Animation Performance**: Complex animations may cause lag
  - Mitigation: Performance testing on mid-range devices, simplify if needed

### Medium Risk
- **Blockchain Integration Issues**: Same contracts, but new hooks
  - Mitigation: Copy proven hooks from frontend-v1, test thoroughly

- **IPFS Upload Reliability**: Pinata API failures
  - Mitigation: Retry logic, error handling, use same Pinata setup as v1

### Low Risk
- **Design Consistency**: Many components to build
  - Mitigation: Design system first approach, component library
