## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**
- Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, security audits, OpenZeppelin contracts
- Contingency: Bug bounty program post-launch

**Risk 2: IPFS Upload Failures**
- Mitigation: Multiple IPFS providers, retry logic, error handling
- Contingency: Fallback to centralized storage temporarily

**Risk 3: Gas Cost Too High**
- Mitigation: Gas optimization, batch operations, careful contract design
- Contingency: Layer 2 migration post-hackathon

### Timeline Risks

**Risk 4: Scope Too Ambitious**
- Mitigation: MVP-first approach, prioritize core features
- Contingency: Cut non-essential features (offers, bundles, reputation)

**Risk 5: Testing Insufficient**
- Mitigation: Test-driven development, automated testing
- Contingency: Focus on critical path testing

### Market Risks

**Risk 6: Creator Adoption Slow**
- Mitigation: Partnership with creator communities, EKRAF outreach
- Contingency: Incentive program for early adopters

**Risk 7: Regulatory Changes**
- Mitigation: Monitor OJK announcements, compliance-first design
- Contingency: Adapt quickly to new requirements
