### Design:
- ✅ Consistent color scheme (purple/blue throughout)
- ✅ High-quality screenshots (all yours are 2-4MB, perfect!)
- ✅ Plenty of white space (don't cram)
- ✅ Align elements properly (use grid/guides)

### Demo Slides (5-8):
- 🎯 These are your STAR slides - make them shine!
- 🎯 Screenshots should be large (60-70% of slide)
- 🎯 Add callout annotations if possible (arrows, highlights)
- 🎯 Show the glassmorphism UI prominently

### Technical Slides (9-10):
- 💡 Keep diagrams simple
- 💡 Highlight "100% coverage" and "0 critical issues"

### Final Slide (15):
- 🚀 Make URL HUGE: `karyachain.rectorspace.com`
- 🚀 Add QR code (use qr-code-generator.com)
- 🚀 This is what judges will remember!
